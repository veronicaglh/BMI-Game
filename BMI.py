# This program will calculate the BMI of a user
# It also had a GUI that has been built with tkinter
# In addition it also has a Game Mode(optional) which lets users
# guess their BMI and the program will tell them when they are hot or cold.
# This program does need the pillow package to work properly
# So if you have not installed that you can install it
# by running the following command on your IDE's terminal
# pip install pillow
